# Portfolio Webpage

### version 1

Although still naive, here is displayed some of my projects over the years. <br>
As I build more, I will be updating my progress here, all while adding more meaningful <br>
features. I must say, building this portfolio was a learning experience. I look forward <br>
not only to improving my web development skills but also my software development <br>
expertise.

## Future Updates Will Include

- video loop for project content
- animations
- feedback functionality to 'say hi' button

## Included Files Worth Mentioning

- index.html
- css directory: contains sass file and linking css file
- portfolio-v3.fig: mockup of initial web page renditions
- images directory: all images used in web page, references found in index.html
