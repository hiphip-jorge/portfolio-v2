# Portfolio Webpage

### version 2

Although still naive, here is displayed some of my projects over the years. <br>
As I build more, I will be updating my progress here, all while adding more meaningful <br>
features. I must say, building this portfolio was a learning experience. I look forward <br>
not only to improving my web development skills but also my software development <br>
expertise.

## Future Updates Will Include

- animations
- feedback functionality to 'say hi' button / feedback / contact section
- include valuable content
- include backend if necessary

## Included Files Worth Mentioning

- build directory: contains files necessary for deployment
- node module directory; contains files necessary for React
- public directory: contains index.html as well as iconography
- src directory: contains all the source code including images and components
